# Change Log

## 1.1

- Fixed a case in Man-Eating Swamp where it would not re-enter the lake after a battle.
- Changed the logic to horror/lake lord detection to attempt to detect them for every battle, not just after a certain bait level. The previous method turned out to not work very well because fish occasionally respawn while fishing, so it was possible to catch a normal battle with horror level bait.

## 1.0

- Initial release
